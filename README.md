**Most Updated Version**

**Work In Progess**

***Removing Not Free Resources - First version should be only cyber deception related items that are accessible***

A curated list of awesome Cyber Deception and Threat Intelligence resources

This list compiles resources published primarily after 2020, ensuring the information remains up-to-date. It is a work in progress, building upon the foundation laid by the Awesome-Deception project, which is now outdated.

**Cyber Deception** can be succinctly defined as: *a deliberate act of misguiding or misleading adversaries by providing false information, creating fictitious assets, or simulating vulnerabilities, with the intent to manipulate their behavior and decisions. This strategy enhances security by diverting, detecting, or delaying attacks, allowing defenders to gain insights and respond more effectively.*

**Cyber Threat Intelligence** can be succinctly defined as: *evidence-based knowledge, encompassing context, mechanisms, indicators, implications, and actionable recommendations, pertaining to a current or emerging threat or hazard. This information aids in making informed decisions about how to respond to such threats.*

This version aims for clarity and flow, while retaining the original meaning and remove outdated non relevant parts.

    <td>GenAIPot is the first open-source A.I. honeypot that pushes the boundaries of cybersecurity. Unlike traditional honeypots, GenAIPot leverages cutting-edge Generative AI to emulate services making it harder to detect. What sets it apart is its ability to generate deceptive content in real-time based on the user instructions, tailored to specific setup. By dynamically responding to free-text user inputs and utilizing OpenAI's chatgpt API services, GenAIPot demonstrates the next evolution in cybersecurity of honeypots and deception-based systems.</td>
